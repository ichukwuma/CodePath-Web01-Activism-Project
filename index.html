          <h2 id=abt-my-topic-title>About My Topic</h2>
          <p>What many people fail to realize is that food is one of the most pressing issues in the U.S. among lower
            income
            families, especially since they may be living pay-check to pay-check, have low savings, and may be set back
            in
            cash
            due to unexpected financial crisis/emergencies. According to <a
              href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america">Feeding America</a> more than 34 million people in
            the
            U.S.,suffer from food insecurity. Due to the recent pandemic (COVID-19), food insecurity has increased
            within
            communites of color and rural communities. Even though these communities are suffering from such problems,
            many
            still do not qualify for federal nutrition programs that are created to help families struggling with food
            insecurity.

        <h4>Food insecurity is not only common among adults, but also children as well.</h4>
        <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
        <p>Within the U.S. this problem can have detrimental effects on households with incomes below the federal
          poverty
          line
          according to the <a
            href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20food%20insecurity,had%20very%20low%20food%20security.">USDA.</a>
          <br>
          This makes it more difficult for low-incomed families to provide food and
          other resources to their children at the expense of survival.

          Out of the 45 million Americans living in the U.S. <br> over 13 million current households are struggling
